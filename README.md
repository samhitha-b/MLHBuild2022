  -RPS: plays rock, paper, scissors
  -translator: simple translator

  -deepgram: uses deepgram to transcribe speech
  -cipher: a simple caesar cipher. wanted to make a better one but didn't get much time :weary:

T'was my first hackathon. I had a lot of ideas but unfortunately didn't get time to bring those to life. I will still complete them though, but these were some of my submissions for MLH Build 2022.
